\title{Optimal transport plans given a pre-specified cost}
\usage{
transport_plan_given_C(
  mass_x,
  mass_y,
  p = 2,
  cost = NULL,
  method = "exact",
  cost_a = NULL,
  cost_b = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mass_x}{The empirical measure of the first sample}

\item{mass_y}{The empirical measure of the second sample.}

\item{p}{The power of the Wasserstein distance}

\item{cost}{Specify the cost matrix in advance.}

\item{method}{The transportation method to use, one of "exact","networkflow","shortsimplex","sinkhorn","greenkhorn", "randkhorn", "gandkhorn"}

\item{cost_a}{The cost matrix for the first sample with itself. Only used for unbiased Sinkhorn}

\item{cost_b}{The cost matrix for the second sample with itself. Only used for unbiased Sinkhorn}

\item{...}{Additional arguments for various methods:
\itemize{
\item{"niter":}{ The number of iterations to use for the entropically penalized optimal transport distances}
\item{"epsilon":}{ The multiple of the median cost to use as a penalty in the entropically penalized optimal transport distances}
\item{"unbiased":}{ If using Sinkhorn distances, should the distance be de-biased? (TRUE/FALSE)}
}}
}
\value{
A transportation plan as a list with slots "from","to", and "mass".
